       <h4> Persian Rugs</h4><br>
       <h4> Handwoven Persian rugs appreciate a lot over the years—although it takes a long time for that to happen. 
        That rug your great-grandparent purchased may just be worth something now. 
        Rugs that are more than 100 years old are considered antiques and their price is determined by size, material, knot-density, condition, and design. <br>

        <h4>Hand-Carved Duck Decoys</h4><br>
        <h4>   Duck decoys became highly collectable in the mid-20th century and prices have never been higher for pristine items. <br>
            If you've inherited one, you could earn up to hundreds of thousands of dollars at an auction.<br>

            <h4>Super Bowl Memorabilia</h4>  
        <h4>    If you were lucky enough to get your hands on a pair of Super Bowl tickets back in the day, you could earn a big payout from holding onto them. <br>
            Most of these paper tickets have a blue or yellow stripe on the top which, according to Sports Collectors Daily, sell for between $200 to $1,000.<br>
             If you held onto tickets with white stripes on top, you could make up to $4,000. Of course, it depends on the popularity of the game, as well.<br>
              Super Bowl II and Super Bowl XII tickets are particularly rare.

            <h4> Comic Books</h4>
        <h4>     Of course, as with anything, rare comic books hold more value than common editions. <br>
             In fact, a rare copy could be worth millions. But don't fret: More common books could still make you hundreds. Not too bad.  <br>

             <h4>Windsor-Style Armchair</h4>
        <h4>    Antiques Roadshow producer Marsha Bemko checked in with appraiser Stephen L. Fletcher of Skinner, Inc.,<br>
             who reports that your circa-1820s "Rod Back" Windsor Armchair was likely made in the New England area. <br>
             "There were many makers of these types of chairs, so it's hard to trace it to a specific region or manufacturer,” he says.<br>
              While the paint and pin- striping appear to be original, the chair’s legs have been cut off at some point, lowering its value. “The seat height should be about 17 inches,” <br>
              he says. “Yours was shortened to 14 1/2 inches, likely for comfort or because it was too tall for a table.”   <br>
